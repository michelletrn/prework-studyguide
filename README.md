# Prework Study Guide Webpage
## Description
This project is one I created for coding bootcamp to help me create a simple webpage before the actual course starts. It provides a space where I can enter notes on HTML, CSS, JS as well as randomly suggesting what to study in the console. I learnt the basics and familiarized myself with the syntax of each language and developed understanding of how each component contributes to the final page.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
